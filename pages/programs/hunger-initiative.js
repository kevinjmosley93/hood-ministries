        <h1 className="text-center">Overview</h1>
        <p>
          It is the mission, duty and purpose of the Hunger Initiative of
          Helping Others Obtain Destiny is to address, educate, coordinate, and
          provide aid and relief to eradicate chronic malnutrition and hunger on
          a local and global level.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          It is our duty to be available when we are capable to provide one of
          the most important yet basic human rights to ordinary people during
          times of extraordinary tribulation by trying to help them to secure
          their humanity through the provision of food.
        </p>
        <p>
          The right to food is a human right derived from the International
          Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). The United
          Nations Special Report in 2002 defined it as follow: “Right to
          adequate food is a human right, inherent in all people, to have
          regular, permanent and unrestricted access, either directly or by
          means of financial purchases, to quantitatively and qualitatively
          adequate and sufficient food corresponding to the cultural traditions
          of people to which the consumer belongs, and which ensures a physical
          and mental, individual and collective fulfilling and dignified life
          free of fear.”
        </p>

        <p>
          The right to adequate food is realized when every man, woman and
          child, alone or in community with others, have the physical and
          economic access at all times to adequate food or means for its
          procurement.
        </p>

        <h1 className="text-center">Education</h1>

        <p>
          Helping Others Obtain Destiny provides education on chronic
          malnutrition and hunger through the dissemination of facts, charts,
          graphs, and statistics. We provide this information by presenting live
          media interviews, lectures and slideshows and written literary
          articles,” at schools, libraries and other public venues. These
          presentations focus on the causes, current efforts and solutions to
          chronic malnutrition and hunger. They also highlight the geographical,
          economical, and social aspects of chronic malnutrition. Examples of
          said presentations that have been given are at Tree of Life
          International Ministries in Chicago Illinois, Castle Motorworks
          Company in Broadview Illinois, other offices and public buildings
          around Illinois. We take advantage of various social media outlets
          such as discussion forums, blogs and social networking sites. Some of
          media outlets that have conducted and featured Helping Others Obtain
          Destiny. All media interviews can be viewed on the corporation’s
          website: {' '}
           <a style={{ color: 'blue' }} href="/">www.helpingthehood.org</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          We also chronicle our efforts and activities on the corporation’s
          website. One feature that will be incorporated into the website is an
          educational essay written by professionals such as public health
          administrators, dietitians, physicians, and activists in the same or
          related field(s). By offering educational events as well as our
          publications and website, Helping Others Obtain Destiny is educating
          the public on subjects useful to individuals and beneficial to the
          community and is advocating and defending human and civil rights
          secured by law.
        </p>

        <h1 className="text-center">Disaster Relief</h1>

        <p>
          Helping Others Obtain Destiny aims to provide disaster relief aid in
          the form of food and water to the severely disadvantaged who are
          affected by either a lack of existing community resources or a lack of
          funding and supplies to existing local infrastructures in the time of
          need. Helping Others Obtain Destiny operates and focuses its resources
          locally and globally to communities who meet the aforementioned
          criteria regardless of their geographical location.
        </p>

        <p>
          Examples of the severely disadvantaged populations would be similar to
          those affected by natural disasters and the displaced victims of
          sectarian and ethnic violence such as the devastating results of the
          Hurricane Katrina in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi and the
          refugees of Rwanda civil war in Africa.
        </p>

        <p>
          We provide disaster relief aid through organizing volunteers to serve
          in affected areas by coordinating and carrying out the distribution of
          food and water. The provisions will be derived from our general fund
          and public support.
        </p>

        <h1 className="text-center">Distribution to Other Organizations and Individuals</h1>

        <p>
          We do not fundraise for any specific organization and Helping Others
          Obtain Destiny is not organized solely to contribute or fundraise for
          any specific entity. However, at the discretion of the board of
          directors we may at times, choose to contribute to other organizations
          who share a similar mission and only if the contributions further our
          exempt status, with the objective to eliminate and alleviate chronic
          malnutrition and hunger.
        </p>

        <p>
          One example of an organization which we may contribute to is the
          “Greater Chicago Food Depository” which is a U.S.-based, nonprofit,
          nonpartisan 501 (c)(3) tax exempt charitable organization. The Food
          Depository has a bold plan to meet the growing and changing needs of
          our community. Our Nourish Campaign includes upgrades to our existing
          facility, a new prepared meals kitchen and more.
        </p>

        <p>
          Helping Others Obtain Destiny may exercise its right under law to
          contribute to non 501 (c)(3) organizations only on the condition that
          Helping Others Obtain Destiny retains control over the use of the
          funds and maintaining records showing that the funds are used for
          exclusively charitable purposes in accordance to our mission.
        </p>

        <h1 className="text-center">Programs for Volunteers</h1>

        <p>
          At times, per the discretion of the board of directors, we may provide
          internships or volunteer opportunities which will provide
          opportunities for involvement in outreach activities and programs in
          order to have a greater impact for change. One of the activities that
          volunteers may be involved in is basic education on topics such as
          nutrition, diet, agricultural techniques, livestock growing, and water
          treatment in order to promote sustainability. Such activities shall
          always be free of charge to participants and will not include
          compensation to the volunteers.
        </p>

        <h1 className="text-center">Multimedia</h1>
        <p>
          It is our goal to bring awareness from every medium possible and this
          does not exclude documentaries and photos of our activities, projects,
          programs and expeditions. By documenting and reporting our efforts we
          intend to broaden our outreach. These multimedia features will be
          recorded by our volunteers during the aforementioned activities and
          will be available to the public.
